# LabLink Configuration: Use Case 1 - IP-Only (No DNS, No SSL)
# Simplest deployment: Access allocator via public IP address over HTTP
#
# ✅ NO RATE LIMITS - Perfect for frequent testing and development
# No DNS or SSL means no certificate issuance limits
#
# Use this when:
# - You don't have a domain name
# - You want fastest setup for testing
# - SSL/HTTPS is not required
# - Testing infrastructure changes frequently
# - Avoiding Let's Encrypt rate limits
#
# Prerequisites:
# - None (no domain or DNS required)
#
# Setup:
# 1. Run setup script: ./scripts/setup-aws-infrastructure.sh
# 2. Deploy infrastructure
# 3. Note allocator IP from Terraform output
#
# Access URL: http://<ALLOCATOR_IP>:5000 (IP will be output after deployment)
